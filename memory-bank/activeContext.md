## Next Steps (Immediate)

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning 🚧

**Priority**: High

**Tasks**:
1. **Choose Technology Stack** (Critical Decision)
   - Backend language: Python vs Node.js/TypeScript
   - Frontend framework: React vs Vue.js vs Next.js
   - Cloud platform: AWS vs GCP
   - Rationale needed for each decision

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Initialize codebase structure
   - Set up package management
   - Configure development tools (linters, formatters)
   - Create Docker setup for local development

3. **Configure Cloud Infrastructure**
   - Choose cloud platform
   - Set up development/staging/production environments
   - Configure databases (PostgreSQL, Redis)
   - Set up monitoring and logging

4. **Establish CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Choose CI/CD platform
   - Set up automated testing
   - Configure deployment pipelines
   - Set up environment management

## Recent Changes

### 2025-01-27
- Project initialized
- Documentation structure created
- Memory bank established
- All foundational documents created

## Active Decisions

### Decision 1: Technology Stack Selection
- **Status**: Pending
- **Options**: 
  - Backend: Python (FastAPI) vs Node.js (Express.js)
  - Frontend: React vs Vue.js vs Next.js
  - Cloud: AWS vs GCP
- **Impact**: High - affects all development work
- **Deadline**: Before Phase 2 begins
- **Stakeholders**: Development team, Architecture team

### Decision 2: Database Schema Design
- **Status**: Pending
- **Dependencies**: Technology stack decision
- **Impact**: High - affects data layer development
- **Deadline**: Early Phase 2

### Decision 3: API Design
- **Status**: Pending
- **Dependencies**: Technology stack decision
- **Impact**: Medium - affects frontend-backend integration
- **Deadline**: Phase 2

## Current Blockers

### Blocker 1: Technology Stack Decision
- **Type**: Decision required
- **Impact**: Blocks all development work
- **Resolution**: Need stakeholder input and evaluation
- **Owner**: Architecture team

### Blocker 2: Supplier Data Source
- **Type**: External dependency
- **Impact**: Blocks recommendation engine development
- **Resolution**: Identify and integrate supplier APIs
- **Owner**: Product team

## Active Questions

1. **What is the source of supplier plan catalog data?**
   - Public APIs?
   - Third-party data providers?
   - Manual import?

2. **What APIs are available for customer usage data?**
   - Utility company APIs?
   - Third-party aggregators?
   - Manual upload only?

3. **What is the team's expertise with different technologies?**
   - Python vs Node.js experience?
   - React vs Vue.js experience?
   - AWS vs GCP experience?

4. **What is the timeline for MVP?**
   - When is first release needed?
   - What features are critical for MVP?

## Work in Progress

### None Currently

All initialization tasks are complete. Ready to begin Phase 1.

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Schedule technology stack decision meeting**
   - Review requirements
   - Evaluate options
   - Make decision
   - Document rationale

2. **Research supplier data sources**
   - Identify available APIs
   - Evaluate data quality
   - Determine integration approach

3. **Set up development environment**
   - Once technology stack is decided
   - Initialize project structure
   - Configure tooling

## Notes

- Project is in early initialization phase
- All foundational documentation is complete
- Ready to proceed with technology decisions and setup
- Memory bank is established for knowledge persistence
